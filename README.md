## Hi, I'm Brian 👋

I'm a web, mobile, and desktop application engineer with extensive experience.
I've led teams at Superlist, SoundCloud, and Zappos, and written some of the
most popular open source packages for Dart and Flutter, such as:

- 🛠️ [Flutter Architecture Samples](https://github.com/brianegan/flutter_architecture_samples)
- ⚡ [RxDart](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxdart)
- 🔄 [Redux.dart](https://github.com/fluttercommunity/redux.dart) & [flutter_redux](https://github.com/brianegan/flutter_redux)
- 📦 [scoped_model](https://github.com/brianegan/scoped_model)

Now, I'm looking for a new challenge. Need an experienced Engineer or
Engineering Manager?
